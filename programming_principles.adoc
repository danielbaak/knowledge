= Programming Principles

dynamic polymorphism (aka inclusion / parametric polymophism)

generics aka static polymorphism

(explicit) interface vs class vs object, implicit interface as used by
C&plus;&plus; static polymorphism, syntactic vs semantic interface,
implementation of, instance of, messageb passing, .... see also gotw, what's
in a class -- the interface principle. An example of a free function (actually
an operator) where the class is not the first but the second parameter is the
canonical implementation of operator<<.

inheritance vs subtyping, Liskov

(class) invariants, preconditions, postconditions, (ref to semantic interface)

closure, lambda, (member) method, (member) function, procedure, class static
method, free (aka nonmember) function, tail call, functor, function object,
delegate, function/method pointer, instance method, field

== Overview

observable side effect = modifying non-local variable or I/O
(strict) side effect = observable side effect or modifying local variable
idempotent = produces always same effects for same input
referentially transparent / pure function = idempotent and no observable side effects

When `locals' are closed over they are not really locals anymore. Here I/O
includes what C++ dubes volatile.

=== Side effect

- strictly: any modifaction of any state, in particular including modifying
  locals
- looser (aka _observeable side effects_?, aka _action_) definition, which
  mostly is meant by developpers: side effects (in a strict sense) that are
  observeable from the function caller. E.g. modifying a non-local
  variable. Note that in general derefering a pointer/reference potentially
  yields a non-local variable, so in genereal no referee can be
  modified. *to-do* difference to observeable behaviour?
- C++: \[intro.execution] Accessing an object designated by a volatile glvalue
  (3.10), modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, or calling a
  function that does any of those operations are all side effects, which are
  changes in the state of the execution environment.

IO: Doing IO is apparently assumed to always have an observeable
effect. E.g. do the following IO have side effects? Get current time, random
number generator, write to /dev/null. The effects, appart from returning a
value, of these function calls are not observe able.

Etymology: Computing the return value of a is considered a function's primary
effect. Followingly further effects are side effects.

=== Observable behaviour

- C++: See the standard
- http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObservableState.html


=== Idempotent operation
An operation that will produce, for a given set of arguments, always the same
effects. Note that this includes side effects. E.g. it might set a non-local
variable to a constant.


=== Pure function
A function that is idempotent and has no observeable side-effects.

Notable consequences: [Assuming no function is returned that closes over local
variables] It can write-to/read-from local variables, cannot write to
non-local variables, can read from immutable non-local variables, cannot do
I/O [however Wikipedia's site on pure function has a chapter saying
otherwise]. Remember that in general it is unknown whether the pointee of a
pointer is a local or a non-local variable.

C++ compilers:

$$__attribute__ ((pure))$$: Is not allowed to write non-local variable [Is
pure in the sense that it's only effect is to return a value]

$$__attribute__ ((const))$$: Is not allowed to read/write non-local variable
Etymology: How close a function in the context of a programming language comes
to the concept of a function in mathematics.


=== Referentially transparent(RT) expression

An expression that can be replaced with the result of evaluating it, without
affecting the observable result of the program. Absence of obervable side
effects is a necessary but not sufficient condition for RT.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8346119/a-grasp-of-immutable-datastructures/8346779#8346779.

The following SO answer says that RT has no universally agreed upon
definition, so it the tern RT should not be used. From my point of view however the definitions I have seen so far are pretty consistent.

== Memory / dynamic memory management

The malloc family of dynamic memory management functions internally build on
top of virtual memory regions provided by the kernel: typically a contiguous
heap and a set of pages via anonymous memory mapping.

In case of POSIX, the heap's size can be adjusted via the brk (program break)
and sbrk system calls.  Note that technically only it's end address can be
modified, i.e. it's a contiguous virtual memory region, i.e. when there are
large free gaps between used heap regions, they can't be given back to the
kernel.

In case of POSIX, anonymous memory mapped pages can be mapped with the mmap
system call.

In C&plus;&plus;, double delete is undefined behavior: https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/freestore-mgmt#double-delete-disaster, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9169774/what-happens-in-a-double-delete.

In C&plus;&plus;, all pointers into a freed memory region are invalidated: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_delete.
