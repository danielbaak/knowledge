= why emacs

== fas
- MS makes easy things easy and hard things (nearly) impossible.
  * However MS decides for you what the easy things are. If your easy thing is
    unimportant for MS, then you're fucked.

== As in other IDEs
And always for all (many) modes (programming/meta languages) 
   
- Templates (but more customizeable, always the same type on the same shortcut)
- flyspell
- flymake
- search(-replace) in files
  But also:
  * via dired / find-dired & mark more complex selection of files
  * interrupt search/replace and continue later
  * tags-loop-continue
- (keyboard)macros
- support for (any) version ctrl system
- highlightening
- debugger (only nice ide for gdb/(perl?))  
- spellcheck  
  
== As in other better IDEs
- Programable
- Good interface to *nix tools. Don't reinvent the wheel, let things be done by
  tools that already exist and that are good at their job.
  * dired
  * find-dired
  * find-grep-dired
  * grep
  * shell-command, shell-command-on-region, dired-do-shell-command
  * shell
  
== No (direct) support
- Refactoring - but with the given abilities (mark class/defun/kill/yank/tempos)
  I'm sure you're faster than with a dialog based IDE.
  
== Emacs
- Everybody can decide what is important for him, what has to be easy. There are
  many many uses of Emacs.
- Filladapt
- Outlinemode for idl/h
- Make modes for your own prog|markup language
- Copy c++ method decl/def to def/decl

== Other things in emacs
- Play (simple) games
- Calculator
- Comint
  - Maple
  - Matlab
  - ....
