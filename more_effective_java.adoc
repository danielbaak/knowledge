== Item 2: Consider a Builder when faced with many constructor parameters

Problem: A constructor call with many parameters is difficult to understand since the reader doesn't know what each argument means. [However he could use an IDE that tells him, but for that he has to ask interactively for each argument separetly in case of a long parameter list.]

Solution using the Builder pattern: Simulates named optional parameters as found in Python.

--------------------------------------------------
public class C {
  private int data1;
  private int data2;
  private int data3;

  public static class Builder {
    private int data1 = /*default value*/;
    private int data2 = /*default value*/;
    private int data3 = /*default value*/;

    public Builder() {}
    public Builder data1(int val) { data1 = val; return this; }
    public Builder data2(int val) { data2 = val; return this; }
    public Builder data3(int val) { data3 = val; return this; }
    public C build() { return new C(this); }
  }

  private C(Builder builder) {
    data1 = builder.data1;
    data2 = builder.data2;
    data3 = builder.data3;
  }
}

// Client Code:
C c = new C.Builder().data2(...).data1(...).build();
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Costs: Cost of constructing the extra Builder class, cost of metho call for each parameter and it's quite a verbose pattern.



== Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or enum type
Implementations of the singleton pattern:

- public static final field to give access to the singleton and let all
  constructors be private.
- As above, but instead a field a (factory) method.  Gives more flexibility
  since you can change your mind and implement the method differently.  At
  least for simple methods being equivalent to a simple field, modern JVM
  implementations are almost certain to inline the call.
- Make an enum type with one element (named e.g. +INSTANCE+).

Downsides of the singleton pattern in general:

- Depending on the concrete implementation of the singleton pattern, unit
  testing can become difficult since the real object can't be replace by a
  test double.


== Item 4: Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor
Not declaring an constructor does not mean there is no constructor: the
compiler generates for a public (private, ...) class a public (private, ...)
default constructor.  Declaring private destructor ensures that no class
(apart from the `current' class) can instantiate an instance.  If the
constructor body throws, e.g. an +AssertionError+, then we're also guarded
against the case that the `current' class accidentaly creates an instance.


== Item 5: Avoid creating unnecessary objects
++String s = "foo";++ instead ++String s = String("foo");++.  The later form
creates two objects instead only one.  Note that it is guaranteed that only
one String object is created for multiple equal string literals.

Consider using static factory methods (Item 1) over invoking constructor,
since their implementation can return reused objects.  That works well for
immutable objects or mutable objects where one knows they are not modified,
e.g. objects referenced only by static private references.

Note that boxed primitive types are objects, thus autoboxing potentially
creates new objects.  Prefer primitive types to boxed types, and watch out for
unintentional autoboxing.


== Item 6: Eliminate obsolete object references
When a reference continues to life much longer after the referenced object is
no longer needed, consider 1) nullifying the reference when the referent is no
longer used 2) using soft or weak or phantom references (or collections using
them internally).  To debug memory leak problems, consider using a heap
profiler.

That is often the case when 1) a class manages its own memory (e.g. consider a
stack based on an array: the pop method should nullify its reference to the
returned object) 2) a class acts as a cache 3) a class stores a collection of
listeners or other callbacks (where it is not unlikely that the clients
forget to deregister the listener or callback).


== Item 7: Avoid finalizers
When finalizers are called is primarily a function of the garbage collector,
i.e. a property of the JVM implementation you are using, i.e. something which
varies in a non portable way.  If the garbage collector decides there is
nothing to clean up (say because there s lots of memory left), your finalizers
will never be called and you will run out of the resources (e.g. file
descriptors) that you actually wanted to free in the finalizer.  Or, in case
your finalizers free memory, if memory is faster acquired than being freed
through the finalizer, you will run out of memory -- there is no requirement
when the finalizers have to be called other than before the storage is being
reused; also, its valid that a finalizer is not called at all.  ++System.gc++
and ++System.runFinalization++ only increase the odds of finalizers getting
executed, but they don't guarantee it.  Also creating and destroying an object
is _much_ more expensive if a finalizer is being used.

Provide an explicit termination method and require clients to call it.  The
try-finally block is the standard place to do that.  Store in a (private)
field whether an object has been finalized; all member methods have to check
(and potentially throw +IllegalStateException+) that field so they don't use
the object if it is already finalized.  Examples: close methods on
InputStream, OutputStream, java.sql.Connection, cancel method on
java.util.Timer, dispose method on java.awt.Graphics and Window, flush method
on Image.

Legitimiate use of finalizer: 1) Act as ``safety net''.  User is required to
call the termination method as explained before, but in case he forgets it,
which must be treated as a bug, the finalizer does the job and logs a warning
about the bug.  2) [Something with native peers.  But as I see it, that native
peer is just another type of resource, and as described above, the only
half-way reliable way to free non-memory resources is the explicit call to a
termination method.]

If you use an finalizer, remember to call the finalizer of the super class,
e.g. via this pattern ++try { /* your finalizer code */ } finally {
super.finalize(); }++.


== Item 8: Obey the general contract when overriding equals

- Easiest thing to do: don't override +equals+
 * The super class' equal implememtation is good enough. +Object+'s implementation: each instance of a class is equal only to itself.
 * Implement equals with a body throwing +AssertionError+.

Contract for +equals+ [from JavaSE6]. Many classes, including all collection classes, depend on it:

- Reflexive: +x.equals(x)+ must be +true+ for any non-null reference value +x+
- Symmetric: +x.equals(y) == y.equals(x)+ for any non-null reference values x and y.
- Transitive: If +x.equals(y)+ and +y.equals(z)+ return true, then also +x.equals(z)+ must return true, for any non-null reference values x, y and z.
- Consistent:
- +x.equals(null)+ must return false for any non-null reference value x.




== Item 13: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members
You should always reduce accessibility as much as possible.  Public classes
should have no public fields, except for public static final fields
referencing immutable objects.


== Item 14: Minimize mutability
To make a class immutable, follow these rules:

1. No method may produce an externally visible change.  E.g. by not providing
   mutators and by making all fields final.
2. Ensure that the class can't be extended, e.g. by making it final, or make
   the constructors private and provide public static factory methods.
3. Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components.  If your class has any
   fields that refer to mutable objects, ensure that clients cannot obtain
   references to these objects.

Motivation for immutable objects:

- They're simple.
- They're inherently thread-safe.
- They can be shared freely.
- Their internals can be shared.

Downsides:

- They require a separate object for each distinct value, which might impose a
  performance issue.
- Unit Test -ability drops since the possibly of having an mock object which
  is a super class of the real object is no longer possible.

Misc:

- To lessen the downsides
 * Try to anticipate where clients invoke multiple methods in a row, each
   creating a now object, and provide one method doing all the steps
   internally and only creating a new object once.
 * Provide a public mutable companion class, e.g. like StringBuffer is for
   String.
- If not completely immutable, only provide as few mutability as
  possible.  E.g. by default make all fields final and only make them non
  final if there is a compelling reason to make them non-final.
- Small value objects should always be immutable.
- Seriously consider making larger value objects immutable too.


== Item 21: Use function objects to represent strategies
Given an (strategy) interface, e.g:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
public interface Comparator<T> {
  public int compare(T t1, T t2);
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

and an method expecting such a (strategy) interface, e.g. within
java.util.Arrays:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
public static <T> void sort(T[] a, Comparator<? super T> c)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's convenient to use an anonymous class as a concrete strategy class
instanciating the function object:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrays.sort(
  myArray,
  new Comparator<String>() {
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) { ... }
  });
----------------------------------------------------------------------

However each time sort is invoked, a new instance will be created.  Consider
the tips in Item 1 how to avoid unnecessary object creation.
