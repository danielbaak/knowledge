= Merging in general and in particular with Git

== What you should now

A merge (here meaning 3 way merge (starting with base, A, B) opposed to 2-way merge (starting only with A, B)):  All of this is clear to you, most notably point 5.

1. A merge is always about different 4 commits (aka versions): common base, A,
   B, merged result.
2. Correlary: A merge is always about 4 diffs: Base->A, Base->B, A->merged,
   B->merged.
3. The goal of a merge (where you want both sides) is that the diff A->merged
   equals the diff base->B and the diff B->merged equals the diff base->A.
4. Point 1-3 are true also when applying a patch (aka cherry-pick). A rebase
   is a series of cherry-picks.
5. Git merge does almost everything for you. In case there are no merge
   conflicts, you're already done. In case of conflicts, you _only_ have to
   manually resolve the merge _conflicts_. I.e. only the conflicting hunks in
   conflicted files. All the files witout conflicts and all the
   non-conflicting hunks in a conflicted file are allready automatically
   merged and you don't have to care about them.
6. You know how to configure Git and your prefered merge tool so you can
   conveniently resolve merge conflicts as explained in point 5.
7. Starting out with commit A and B, to find the common base commit, Git looks
   only at the graph of commits. Dates are _not_ involved in any way.
8. You know what to do if you think you don't need one side. E.g. one side is
   a bugfix that is not needed in the other side since it was already
   'accidentaly' fixed by another commit. Or you think you need to rewrite the
   patch anyway since the other side had a big refactoring.

== What is a merge / what is a patch

- Is about a DAG of 4 commits/versions / 4 diffs.
- Unfortunatly many tools only show 3 versions. None (that I know of) shows
  all 4 diffs.

- Example:
 * trivial patches
 * non-trivial patches no conflict
 * trivial conflict
 * non trivial conflict

== What Git does for you

- Only resolve the merge conflicts. No need to look at the parts/differences
  which are already automatically merged.
- Has nothing to do with dates.
- git log --merge: show more details

- Gitâ€™s philosophy is to be smart about determining when a merge resolution is
  unambiguous, but if there is a conflict, it does not try to be clever about
  automatically resolving it.


== Non trivial merge conflicts

- Patch A modifies code which is moved by the patch B. The conflict will
  only occure where the function is 'deleted'. One has to know its not deleted
  but moved, and manually apply patch A also where the code block is 'inserted.
- One patch becomes obsolete: A: delete function B: fix bug within that function
- Semantic merge conflict not automatically dedected:
 * A: rename B: New (includes moving [=delete + new]) usage of that idendifier

== tips / howto
- Eo merge always with clean working tree, altough this is not technically
  required. Rational: to be able to undo _anything_. Does Git warn???
- Before merging into public branch (e.g. 5.3.0), i.e. before pulling with
  public branch: ensure your local version has not diverged from the public
  version.


== Concrete configuring examples

- beyond compare, meld. The `normal' variant with a 3way diff.
- whitespace, lineendings, renames???


=== Howto

!!! talk with you're collegue before merging her stuff for her. She might be
in course of merging herself.o

!!! howto verify working dir is clean and no unpushed changes aka branch does
not diverge.

Let's see how it works out. If we see it doesn't work in practice, we choose
another solution.
