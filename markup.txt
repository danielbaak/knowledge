DocBook family: DocBook, LinuxDoc, Simplified DocBook

RD, RDoc
Wiki family:
Lightweight: AsciiDoc, MarkDown, reStructuredText

Doxygen               

                      
roff::  "I'll **R**un *off* a document"                    
nroff:: newer roff        
troff:: typesetter roff       
groff:: GNU roff        
LinuxDoc::
  LinuxDoc is an SGML DTD which is similar to DocBook. It was created by Matt
  Welsh and version 1.1 was announced [1] in 1994. It is primarily used by the
  Linux Documentation Project.
DocBook::
  DocBook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation. 
POD::
CHM::
  It has a set of web pages written in a subset of HTML and a hyperlinked table
  of contents. CHM format is optimized for reading, as files are heavily
  indexed. All files are compressed together with LZX compression.

=== conversions  
groff -> ps(groff),html(groff),Tex DVI(groff),txt(groff)
reStructuredText -> html(rst2html), latex(rst2latex), ODF(rstd2odt), S5(rst2s5)
Latex -> Tex?
Tex -> DVI(TeX,pdfTeX), PDF(pdfTeX)
DVI -> text(dvitype), pdf(dvipdf[m[x]]), ps(dvips), bitmap(dvipng), svg(dvisvg[m])
PDF -> DVI(dvipdf,dvipdfm,dvipdfmx)
DocBook -> X?HTML, EPUB, PDF, man pages, CHM
CHM -> HTML(hh [windows], extract_chmLib, chm tools package), ??(chmdump)
pod -> HTML(pod2html), man(pod2man), text(pod2text), html(pod2html),
       latex(pod2latex), docbook(pod2docbook)
html -> texi(html2texi)
     
=== historical dependence
runoff -> (troff roff  nroff mal 100, alter name immer wieder wiederverwendet) ->  groff

- User defined quotes/delimiters
- Null-Metastrings/commands to

How to represent special chars? (Umlaut, any given Unicode, ...)  
  
== Formating

Verbatim is not equal to typewriter/monospaced (font), they are in general
completely independent. 

== My Lang           
           
The start of a new 'block' item (list,headers,sections,...) should be dedectable from
the first line, so emacs ouline mode can be easely configured.
           
Paragraphs/ListItems in a way emacs/par/fmt can be easely used
