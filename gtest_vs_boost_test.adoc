= GTest vs boost test

To avoid confusion, when GTest's terminology diverges from boost's
terminology, this document always states both terms like so: (Google:
__Google's term__, boost: __boost's term__). See also <<glossary>>.


[[summary]]
== Conclusion and summary of differences

Whether Xentis should use GTest or boost test depends very much on how the
points in which they differ are prioritized and weighted.  According to my
order of priority, based on my experience in automated testing and on reading
books and web sites on the topic of automated testing, I would prefer GTest
over boost test.

Roughly ordered after priority (see <<kafls_priorities>>), highest first, not
listing points where GTest and boost test are on a par.

== GTest advantages

[[gmock]]
=== More seamless integration of GMock

Boost provides no mock framework.  Google mock aka GMock is an popular one in
the C&plus;&plus; world.  GMock can theoretically be made work with any
testing framework, thus also with boost test, but obviously it integrates most
seamlessly with GTest.

If we would use a GMock together with boost test, then automated tests would
use a mixture of boost's assertions / custom predicates and GMock/GTest's
assertions / custom predicates / matchers.  That is developers had to learn
both worlds.

For more information on what GMock is see <<gmock_intro>>.

Use GMock with boost test: https://www.semipol.de/2010/04/13/using-googlemock-with-the-boost-test-library.html


[[death_tests]]
=== Death tests

In contrast to GTest, boost doesn't provide death tests.  Among other things,
they are useful to ensure that a given assert (the one defined by
C&plus;&plus; in <cassert>) in the UUT actually fires.

Extract from GTest documentation: ++(EXPECT|ASSERT)_DEATH('statement',
'regex')++ asserts that statement crashes with the given error.
++(EXPECT|ASSERT)_EXIT('statement', 'predicate', 'regex')++ asserts that
statement exits with the given error and its exit code matches predicate.
+'statement'+ is a statement that is expected to cause the process to die,
+'predicate'+ is a function or function object that evaluates an integer exit
status, and +'regex'+ is a regular expression that the stderr output of
statement is expected to match.

See https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Death_Tests[GTest].


[[custom_output]]
=== Assertion's custom output is _in addition_ to default output

Both GTest and boost support custom failure messages via use of streaming.
However in GTest that user message is _in addition_ to the default message.
In boost the user message _replaces_ the default message, which means the user
is forced to redundantly duplicate code to also produce the default message,
unless she really meant to completely replace it.  Note that through
<<custom_predicates>>, GTest also supports customize the `default message
part'.

Examples:

boost:
--------------------------------------------------
BOOST_TEST(foo(a)==b);
BOOST_TEST(foo(a)==b, "a=" << a);
--------------------------------------------------

Output (deduced from examples, I couldn't make boost test compile):
--------------------------------------------------
test.cpp(16): error: in "test_message": check foo(a) < b has failed [13 >= 12]
test.cpp(15): error: in "test_message": a=13
--------------------------------------------------

GTest:
--------------------------------------------------
EXPECT_EQ(foo(a), b);
EXPECT_EQ(foo(a), b) << "a=" << a;
--------------------------------------------------

Output:
--------------------------------------------------
main.cpp:29: Failure
Value of: b
  Actual: 1
Expected: foo(a)
Which is: 4
main.cpp:30: Failure
Value of: b
  Actual: 1
Expected: foo(a)
Which is: 4
a=3
--------------------------------------------------

https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Teaching_Google_Test_How_to_Print_Your_Values[GTest],
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/testing_tools/reports.html[boost]


[[matchers]]
=== Matchers

GTest has matchers, which are similar to what
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamcrest[Hamcrest] provides.

I am not sure yet whether boost's custom ``predicates''' are as strong as google
matchers, I guess not.  Even if so, GTest has more matchers readily available.
Granted, boost has BOOST_TEST, see <<boost_test>>.  Still matchers are more
generic, since they are not restricted to operators and since custom matchers
can be written.

Basic idea of matchers: Opposed to e.g. ++EXPECT_TRUE(a>=b && a\<=c)++, one
writes ++EXPECT_THAT(a, AllOf(Ge(b), Le(c)))++, which results in much better
messages in case of failure, because the matchers know how to print themselves
in case of failure.  Also, the concept is much more generic, considering that
custom matchers can easily be written.  That is similar to
<<custom_predicates>>, but yet much cleaner and more generic, since matchers
can be composed, but custom predicates can't.  (Really? Why should't that
technically possible?  It would even be more generic, since with matcher's
you're forced to pass the first arg to assert_that, i.e. the value which is
matched against.)

Example: The following fragment in a test:
--------------------------------------------------
int a = 1;
int b = 2;
int c = 3;
EXPECT_THAT(a, AllOf(Ge(b), Le(c)));
--------------------------------------------------

produces this output:
--------------------------------------------------
main.cpp:27: Failure
Value of: a
Expected: (is >= 2) and (is <= 3)
  Actual: 1 (of type int)
--------------------------------------------------

Note that actually, by historic accident, matchers are implemented in GMock
instead GTest.  See
https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/V1_7_CheatSheet#Matchers[GMock]


[[shuffle_tests]]
=== Shuffle tests
GTest allows to shuffle (Google: tests / boost: test cases). That is useful to
help detect the unwanted case that tests have dependencies. 

See
https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/AdvancedGuide#Shuffling_the_Tests[GTest]


[[documentation]]
=== More complete and generally better documentation

I find the GTest and GMock documentation more complete and generally better
than boost tests'.

E.g. boost's documentation on how to customize the log
output is empty, see
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/test_output/log_compil_time_configuration/custom_log_formatter.html. That
information might be relevant to judge whether boost test can be made to
produce an XML output which Hudson understands.

E.g. boost's BOOST_TEST assertion macro seems pretty awesome since it can
print the value of `every' (that is not really true as it turns out) node of
the expression that makes up the condition.  It does not explain well how what
one has to consider regarding custom types.  Which constructors and/or
operators must be provided?  Which constructors and/or operators cannot be
defined/overloaded?  See also chapter <<boost_test>>.


[[print_custom_types]]
=== Not forced to provide operator<< for custom types

Both GTest and boost test can automatically log the content of objects using
operator<< (i.e. ++ostream& operator<<(ostream&,const MyType&)++). E.g. if the
assertion +EXPECT_EQ(a, b)+ fails, the output contains the content of the
objects a and b, even if they're of custom type, provided that type provides
operator<<. GTest additionally also allows to define the printer via a method
defined like ++void PrintTo(const MyType&, ostream*)++.

In the case of boost, contrary to GTest, the test doesn't compile if no
operator<< for a used type is provided.  To make it compile, one has to either
define operator<<, or use a special macro to tell boost test that this given
type has no operator<<.  This is a big burden when we would start to introduce
boost test, since most of our types don't have operator<< defined.

See
https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Teaching_Google_Test_How_to_Print_Your_Values[GTest] and
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/test_output/testing_tool_output_disable.html[Boost].


[[custom_event_handlers]]
=== Custom test event handlers / customize log format

Opposed to boost, GTest lets you write event handlers.  Events are
e.g. On(TestProgram|TestCase|Test)(Start|End) or OnTestPartResult (when an
assertion fires).

The standard / default printer which is used to log is implemented in terms of
such an event handler.  It can be replaced by a custom printer in order to
customize the format of the log output.  See also <<custom_log_format>>.

See https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Extending_Google_Test_by_Handling_Test_Events[GTest]


[[debug]]
=== More convenient to debug

==== Boost's BOOST_TEST is awkward to debug

Extract boost's documentation: In case you observe a failure in unit tests and
you are using a debugger to determine the cause, it may get really difficult
to step into the expression inside an assertion.  Because BOOST_TEST builds an
expression tree before evaluating it, the "Step Into" function of the debugger
will have to step into every step of building the expression tree before, you
can go into the evaluation of the expression.  More:
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/testing_tools/debugging.html


==== Turn assertion failures into breakpoints

When running the test program under a debugger, optionally the debugger can
catch an assertion failure and drop into interactive mode.  See
https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Turning_Assertion_Failures_into_Break-Points[GTest]

Similar behavior probably can be mimicked with boost by just setting
breakpoints at the right locations in boost source code, but the problem is to
find _all_ locations where a breakpoint needs to be set.


[[better_known]]
=== Known by more developers

https://www.google.com/trends/[Google trends] shows that there is _much_ more
interest in Google test than boost test: see
https://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-13&q=boost%20test%2C%20google%20test&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT-1[here].
So it's more likely that (new) developers know GTest / GMock than boost test.
However, obviously, the data coming from Google might be biased. On the other
hand, Google doesn't sell GTest / GMock.



== boost test advantages


[[deep_test_hierarchy]]
=== Arbitrary deep test hierarchy
Testing hierarchy: GTest has exactly three levels (one test program, which
consists of zero or more test cases, each of which consists of zero or more
tests).  Boost's hierarchy is two levels or arbitrarily more.

That might make it easier to select a subset of (Google: test / boost: test
case)s to be run.  On the other hand, I expect that we have one (Google: test
program, boost: ?) per module (e.g. business rules, investment
performance, ...).  Within that test program, a larger than three level
hierarchy is often not needed.  Also GTest offers other means (e.g. regular
expressions matching (Google: test / boost: test case) names or (Google: case
/ boost: test suite) names, just as boost test, to select a subset of (Google:
test / boost: test case)s to be run.


[[assertion_levels]]
=== Three vs two assertion levels
Boost and GTest both have a fatal and a non-fatal assertion, but boost
additionally also has a WARN assertion which only logs but does not modify the
status of the (Google: test / boost: test case).

More details:

GTest: +EXPECT+: non-fatal, i.e. execution of (Google: test / boost: test case)
continues, but the output contains a note that the given assertion failed.
+ASSERT+: fatal: execution of (Google: test / boost: test case) is aborted.
      
boost: +CHECK+: as GTest's +EXPECT+. +REQUIRE+: as GTest's +ASSERT+. +WARN:+
does not change the status of the (Google: test / boost: test case); only logs
a warning message.

Note: both GTest and boost test fail to provide an assertion level I deem very
useful: an assertion level which asserts that preconditions of a test are met.
E.g. if a test fails to setup, then it is unknown what the result of the
`real' assertions in the verify phase is.  Thus it is unknown whether the
specification that goes with the test was met or not, and that fact should be
communicated to the user.  Opposed to wrongly telling him `the specification
was not met'.


[[assertion_bound_context]]
=== Assertion-bound context

Both GTest and boost have (Google: scoped traces / boost: Scope-bound
context), see <<scoped_traces>>.  However boost additionally has what it calls
assertion-bound context: What you `log' with +BOOST_TEST_INFO+ is only really
logged with the next assertion of the current (Google: test / boost: test
case) that actually fires.  That is useful if it's not feasible to provide all
information that one likes to see at the place were the actual assertion
macro is.

--------------------------------------------------
static bool g = true;

void test() {
  BOOST_TEST(g);
}

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(test_case1)
{
  BOOST_TEST_INFO("phase 1");
  g = true;
  test();
  BOOST_TEST_INFO("phase 2");
  g = false;
  test();
}
--------------------------------------------------

Output (deduced from examples, I couldn't make boost test compile):
--------------------------------------------------
test.cpp(14): error: in "test_case1": check false has failed
Failure occurred in a following context:
    phase 2
--------------------------------------------------

See
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/test_output/contexts.html[boost]


[[checkpoints]]
=== Checkpoints

After ++BOOST_TEST_CHECKPOINT(_message_)++, the given message will be printed
if at some later point in the same (Google: test / boost: test case) an
(unexpected) exception occurs.

Example: the following test:
--------------------------------------------------
int foo( int i )
{
  return 1/i;
}

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE( test_external_interface )
{
  for( int i = 3; i>=0; --i ) {
    BOOST_TEST_CHECKPOINT( "Calling foo with i=" << i );
    foo( i );
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

produces this output (deduced from examples, I couldn't make boost test compile):
------------------------------------------------------------
unknown location(0): fatal error in "test_external_interface": signal: integer divide by zero; address of failing instruction: 0x00048090
test.cpp(9): last checkpoint: Calling foo with i=1
------------------------------------------------------------

See http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/test_output/checkpoints.html[boost].


[[unconditional_log_msgs]]
=== More versatile unconditional log messages

Both GTest and boost allow to log unconditionally information into the test's
log output.  However boost's ++BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE( foo << bar << ... )++ lets
you stream arbitrary stuff, while GTest's ++RecordProperty("'key'", 'value')++
is less general.  

https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Logging_Additional_Information[GTest],
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/test_output/test_output_macro_message.html[boost]


[[disabling_assertions]]
=== Disabling assertions to some extend

Both GTest and boost test allow to (temporarily) disable (Google: test / boost:
test case)s. But boost test also allows to disable (Google: test case / boost:
test suite)s and to some extend assertions.

Boost test can via decorators, specify the number of assertions that can fail in
a (Google: test / boost: test case). This is useful when for some reasons it is
known that temporarily N assertions of a (Google: test / boost: test case) fail.


== GTest and boost on a par

Since here GTest and boost are on a par, I don't give any details or examples.

- Both don't enforce having to use fixtures.

- Both support assertions which assert that the UUT throws any exception type,
  or a specific exception type, or doesn't throw at all.  See
  https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Exception_Assertions[GTest],
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/utf_reference/testing_tool_ref.html[boost]

- Both have multiple assertions to compare floating-points in sane ways.
See
https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Floating-Point_Comparison[GTest],
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/testing_tools/extended_comparison/floating_point.html[boost].

[[scoped_traces]]
- Both have (Google: scoped traces / boost: Scope-bound context).  See
  https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Adding_Traces_to_Assertions[GTest],
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/test_output/contexts.html[boost]

- Both report execution times of (Google: test / boost: test case)s

[[lib_dependency]]
- As Glen correctly points out, Xentis already has a dependency to the boost
  library, but not yet to GTest.  However since we most likely want a mock
  library for sane unit testing, and boost doesn't provide a mock library,
  there will be a new library dependency anyway.


=== Details not yet investigated

Points where both are on a par from a broad perspective, where I haven't
looked at the details yet.

[[custom_predicates]]
- Both support custom predicates, which store the Boolean result and a message
  in case of failure.  See
  https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Predicate_Assertions_for_Better_Error_Messages[GTest],
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/testing_tools/custom_predicates.html[boost]

- Both have fixtures.  See
  https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Sharing_Resources_Between_Tests_in_the_Same_Test_Case[GTest test fixture],

[[custom_log_format]]
- Both support to customize the log format / both can be made produce XML
  output that Hudson understands.  I'm not entirely sure with boost, there are
  references that it is possible, but the actual documentation is empty.
https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Extending_Google_Test_by_Handling_Test_Events[GTest],

[[boost_test]]
=== boost test's BOOST_TEST assertion

This chapter is about why I regard the seemingly awesome BOOST_TEST assertion
macro as neutral after all.  It sounds awesome because it boasts that it can
print every the value of every node of the conditional expression.  E.g. if
the following assertion fails:

--------------------------------------------------
BOOST_TEST(a + 1 < b);
--------------------------------------------------

the output will contain:

--------------------------------------------------
test.cpp:18: error: in "mytest": check a + 1 < b has failed [1 + 1 >= 2]
--------------------------------------------------

However as the chapter <<documentation>> explains, it is badly documented what
the rules and restrictions are for custom types.  I don't like the idea that I
never really know what the rules are for custom types.  

The following I found out by experiment:

- It cannot really print the _full_ expression tree.  It works by making the
  left-most operand and boost-internal type, and then use operator overloading
  from there, which is affected by operator precedence and associativity.
  That e.g. means that in ++a*b == c*d++, the nodes +c+ and +d+ are not
  reached.  The output only the values for the nodes +a+, +b+, and +c*d+, but
  not for +c+ and +d+.

- The copy constructor _must_ be defined

- As always in boost test, operator<< must be defined for all types, see
  <<print_custom_types>>.

- Apparently only available since boost 1.59.


== To-do

Minor points which are still open: 

- Probably that GTest's `fatal' assertion `only' leave the current function
  can be viewed as a disadvantage.  I don't know yet how boost implements its
  fatal assertions.  I think its not that much of an disadvantage, since
  EXPECT is probably more often used than ASSERT.  When there are too many
  assertions, be it EXPECT or ASSERT, in a test then it is a smell anyway.
  See
  https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Propagating_Fatal_Failures[GTest].

- boost: Separation of the test errors description (test log) from the results
  report summary (test results report)

- boost: The Unit Test Framework provides the ability to configure what is
  shown in both the test log and the test report.  The configuration is
  supported both at run-time, during test module invocation and at compile
  time from within a test module.

- Testing private functions.  See
  https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_7_AdvancedGuide#Testing_Private_Code[GTest].

- See end of matchers chapter: which is more generic?  matchers or custom
  predicates?


[[kafls_priorities]]
== KAFL's priorities

I am only listing thoughts which affect the list of differences between GTest
and boost test, see <<summary>>, i.e. their priority.

It might be arguable how often a (Google: test / boost: test case) should make
use of a mock library, but not having a mock library at all is certainly the
wrong decision.  Writing an own mock library is certainly the wrong decision
for the usual reasons concerning writing an own library which is far away from
the core business of a company.  Thus we will need to choose a mocking
library, and the testing framework we choose should seamlessly work together
with that mocking library.

Easy to introduce.  See also <<print_custom_types>> which states that boost
test forces to provide operator<< for custom types.  If it's cumbersome to
begin to write new tests, people wont do it, and that's about the worst that
can happen.

High quality log output of a test framework is crucial to get high defect
localization, i.e. to quickly find and then fix the problem in case one or
more tests fail.  In the normal case (and I really mean in practice, not only
in theory) the output is good enough that you rather quickly know how to fix
the problem after just reading the output of the failing assertions.  In the
majority of cases there is no need to run the test again with a debugger
attached or with extra log statements inserted.

However if there is nevertheless a need to debug, the framework should not
impede debugging.

As any book about testing will tell you, you should strive after making tests
independent of each other.


[[gmock_intro]]
== Tiny GMock introduction

It doesn't make sense to write yet another introduction to GMock at this place,
the reader is redirected to
https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/V1_7_ForDummies[gmock for dummies], or
https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/V1_7_Documentation[all GMock docu].
However, the following is to an large extend a copy paste from another document
I wrote about automated testing.

In GMock, a mock is an object which's methods can do simple actions and
possibly additionally can have expectations on the number of times and the
order they are called.

A mocks's method can execute simple _actions_.  These actions are defined on a
per object basis using the ON_CALL macro.  Such simple actions can for example
be `return a fix value' or `set an output parameter to a fix value' or
`delegate the call to another object/method'. The defined actions are then
executed when the method is called during exercising the test.  Using GMock,
each method of a mock object automatically has a default action which is
executed when no other action is defined.

A method _additionally_ can have _expectations_, definable using the macro
EXPECT_CALL, again on every object independently.  The possible expectations
are how exactly the UUT has to use / call the mock object.  Say the mock
object has the methods foo and bar, then a test can define expectations such
as:

* _Cardinality_: Method foo must be called exactly 3 times.  Or bar must be
  called at least 2 times.

* _Order_: Method foo and method bar must be called in exactly that order - see
  http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/ForDummies#Ordered_vs_Unordered_Calls[ordered calls]

* Use matchers to refine the definition of an expectation: foo must be called
  with either 2.1 or 3.1414 as argument - see
  http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/ForDummies#Matchers[matchers].


Example:
--------------------------------------------------
// interface which is used by the class under test, and which during
// producution is implemented by some production code class, and in a given
// test by a mock (aka test double)
class MyInterface {
public:
  virtual int bar() = 0;
  virtual int foo(int, double) = 0;
};

class MyMock : public MyInterface {
public:
  MOCK_METHOD0(bar, int());
  MOCK_METHOD2(foo, int(int, double));
};

class MyClassUnderTest {
public:
  void fred(const MyInterface&) {
  }
};

TEST(MyTestCase, MyTest) {
  // setup section
  MyClassUnderTest uut;
  MyMock mock;
  ON_CALL(mock, bar())
    .WillByDefault(Return(42)); // defines action: mock.bar() now always
                                // returns 42 when called
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(3,_)) // defines expectation: when mock.foo is called,
                              // the value of the first arg must be 42. The
                              // value of the 2nd arg is irrelevant
    .Times(AtLeast(1))   // defines expectation: mock.foo must be called at
                         // least one time
    .WillOnce(Return(1)) // defines action for the 1st call: to return 1
    .WillOnce(Return(2)) // defines action for the 2nd call: to return 2
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(42)); // defines action for all following calls: to
                                 // return 42

  // exerice section
  uut.fred(mock);

  // (implicit) verify section
  // dtor of mock will now verify if the expectations were met.  If they were
  // not, the test fails with an appropriate nice log explaining what
  // happened.
