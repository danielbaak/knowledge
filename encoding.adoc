= Character Encoding


_Character encoding_ pairs each (abstract) character (aka grapheme, see below) of an alphabet with something else, e.g. a bit / byte sequence or an (integral) number (often called code point).  In practice, the therm character encoding seems quite vaguely defined; mostly it means an something where the destination is a byte sequence.  Opinions differ whether UNICODE's / UCS's mapping of abstract characters to code points is called a (character) encoding.

Some well-known (in the western world) character encodings :

ASCII:: 1 byte per character, not using the MSB, i.e. only using 7 bits, 95 printable characters (including space) and 33 non-printing controll characters. Subset of most customary encodings, e.g. of UTF-8, all ISO 8859 and Windows-1252.

Unicode:: Defines two `stages' of encodings: 1) an character encoding mapping characters to code points 2) a set of encodings called 'unicode transformation formats' (aka _encoding forms_), each mapping code points to a sequence of code units, e.g. UCS-2, UTF-8, UTF-16, .... Note that even if a fixed-length transformation format is used, there is still the problem of composed characters, so there is not really a win, on the bottom line it's still a variable-length problem.

ISO 10646 and Unicode have an identical repertoire and numbers. ISO 10646 is a simple character map, an extension of previous standards like ISO 8859. In contrast, Unicode adds rules for collation, normalization of forms, and the bidirectional algorithm for right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. To support these rules and algorithms, Unicode adds many properties to each character.


Universal Character Set (UCS) = ISO/IEC 10646:: ... *to-do* write more.

UTF-8:: ... *to-do*

UTF-16:: ... *to-do*. Is a variable-length, encoded with one or two 16-bit code units.

ISO 8859:: Is a joint ISO and IEC series of standards for 8-bit character encodings. There are 15 parts. Part 1 is ``Latin-1 Western European'', Part 2 is ``Latin-2 Central European'' and so on.

ISO 8859-1 (aka latin1):: Part 1 of ISO 8859. 1 byte per character, using 222 of the 255 possible code points. Subset (regarding mapping code point to character) of Windows-1252 and of Unicode; code points 0x00 to 0xFF map to the same characters both in Latin1 and in Unicode.

Windows-1252:: Superset of ISO 8859-1, 1 byte per character, using 250 of the 255 possible code points. Not a subset of Unicode.

ANSI:: A misnomer meaning the Windows-1252 character encoding. Despite the (wrong) name, it never has been an ANSI standart.

Character reference:: In SGML, and thus in derivatives such as HTML or
XML, as an additional character encoding after the native character encoding (UTF-8 etc.), a character can also be encoded with a sequence of characters called character reference.  There are two types of character references: 1) _numeric character reference_, e.g. `&amp;#60;' maps to the character `<' (less-than sign) 2) _character entity reference_, e.g. the character sequence `&amp;lt;' maps to the character `<' (less-than sign).

From N4140\[lex.charset]:

1 The 'basic source character set' consists of 96 characters: ...

3 The 'basic execution character set' ... shall ... contain all the members of
the basic source character set plus [some control characters], plus a 'null
character' ....  The 'execution character set' ... [is] implementation-defined
superset of the basic execution character set.  The values of the members of
the execution character sets ... are locale-specific.  [The whole paragraph
like-wise for the '(basic) execution wide-character set'].

From N4140\[lex.phases]:

- Phase 1: Map 'physical source file characters' ['(physical) source (file)
  character set'?] to the basic source character set.  Any source file
  character not in the basic source character set is replaced by the
  universal-character-name that designates that character.

- Phase 5: Each source character set member in a character literal or a string
  literal, as well as each escape sequence and universal-character-name in a
  character literal or a non-raw string literal, is converted to the
  corresponding member of the execution character set.

== Glossary

Grapheme:: A grapheme is an abstract concept, e.g. the `latin capital letter A'.  Seems to pretty much the same thing as abstract character, at least for the purpose of this document.

Glyph:: A glyph is a specific shape that represents that grapheme. E.g. in each font (Arial, Helvetica, ...) the grapheme `A' would have a diffrent glyph.

Character in computing:: Historically, the term character has been widely used by industry professionals to refer to an encoded character.  Nowadays a character is increasingly being seen as a unit of information, independent of any particular visual manifestation.

text element:: A sequence of one or more characters. Certain of these sequences are called combining character sequences, see there. What a text element exactly is, is dependend on the process of handling the text. E.g. in historic Spanish language sorting, "ll" counts as single text element, but when typed, it's two seperate text elements.

combining character sequence:: See also text element.

character::
code element:: A code element (aka character) is fundamental and useful for computer text processing. Each code element has a single number (called code point) and a unique name (e.g. ``LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A'') assigned. For the most part, code elements correspond to the most commonly used text elements.

code point::
code position:: The number assigned to a code element, see there.

grapheme cluster::
user-perceived character::

code page:: A vendor specific character encoding. The name of a code page is vendor specific and typically a number. The actual definition of the mapping might be something that is well known in a larger scope, e.g. UTF-8 has code page numbers 1208 at IBM, 65001 at Microsoft, 4110 at SAP.
