= Bash Summary

== Lists, Pipes, Commands

=== Commands
See +Command+ in +bash.yas+. The return status of a simple command is its exit
status as provided by the POSIX 1003.1 +waitpid+ function, or 128+N if the
command was terminated by signal N.

=== Pipes
See +Pipe+ in +bash.yas+. A pipe combines commands.  The standard output of
the right command of a pipe operator +|+ is redirected to the standard input
of the left command.

Each command in a pipeline is executed in its own subshell.  The exit status
of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command in the pipeline.  This
can be altered by +pipefail+ option.  If the keyword +!+ precedes the pipe,
the exit status is logically inverted.  The shell waits for all commands in
the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.  The keyword +time+ causes
timing statistics to be printed; the option +-p+ changes the output format to
that specified by POSIX.

// Questions:
// * Why is +time;+ valid but neither of +;+ or +! ;+? Either an empty
//   command is allowed or not.
// * Why doesn't this work +time && time+? Note that this at least works
//   +time echo && time echo+.

=== Lists, and-or-lists
See +List+ and +AndOrList+ in +bash.yas+.  A list combines pipes.

And combination +&&+:: Right pipe is only executed if left pipe's exit status
is 1.  Combined exit status is the result of a logical and operation on the
exit status of the two pipes.

Or combination +||+:: Right pipe is only executed if left pipe's exit status
is 0.  Combined exit status is the result of a logical or operation on the
exit status of the two pipes.

Async and-or-list +&+:: Executes and-or-list asynchronously in a subshell,
also known as executing it in the background.  See also job control how to
figure out when it finished and with what exit status.

Sync and-or-list +;+:: Executes the and-or-list synchronous to current shell.


== ???
=== Bash conditional expressions


== Compound commands / flow control

=== Grouping / Compound
See +CompoundCommand+ in +bash.yas+.

=== Functions
See +FunDef+ in +bash.yas+.

Any redirections associated with the shell function are performed when the
function is executed.  The exit status of a function is the exit status of the
last command executed in the body.  When a function is executed, the arguments
to the function become the positional parameters during its execution.
Special parameter +0+ is unchanged.  The first element of the +FUNCNAME+
variable is set to the name of the function while the function is executing.

A function definition may be deleted using the +-f+ option to the +unset+
builtin.

== Redirections
See +Redirections+ in +bash.yas+.  Redirections are processed from left to
right.  Can appear anywhere within a simple command, but only at the end of a
compound command.  See also +exec+ built in for how to operate on file
descriptors of current shell, in contrast to subshell of command to be called.

The word following the redirection operator, i.e. +FileName...+ in +bash.yas+,
in the following descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace
expansion, tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution,
arithmetic expansion, quote removal, filename expansion, and word splitting.

=== Here string
Here string +<<< WORD+: The WORD undergoes brace expansion, tilde expansion,
parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,
and quote removal but not pathname expansion and word splitting.

=== Here document
..................................................
## Here documents.  The text upto a line containing *only* the delimiter
## is supplied as input.
## No expansion is done on word following <<[-]
$simple
[Fd] "<<"[\-] Word#Del ... #Del

$medium
[Fd] "<<"[\-] @Del(Word) ... \n ## rest of cmd upto 1st unqoted \n
  ...        ## here document, incl trailing newline
  @>Del\n;   ## line containing only delimiter

[Fd] << [-] Delimiter
..................................................

After the list(?) any sequence of characters form the input, until a line which
ONLY contains delimiter.  Details: Delimiter can be any word.  No parameter
expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or filename expansion is
performed on Delimiter.  If any characters in WORD are quoted, the DELIMITER is
the result of quote removal on WORD, and the lines in the here-document are not
expanded.  If Delimiter is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected
to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.  If the
redirection operator is ``<<-'', then all leading tab characters (only tab, no
other white spaces) are stripped from input lines and the line containing
DELIMITER.  This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a
natural fashion.

Multiple here documents in a list are possible.  See help for quoting/expansion
rules for Delimiter and supplied input.

// Todo:
// * Bash handles several filenames specially when they are used in
//   redirections, as described in the following table: All /dev/**


== Command line processing

1. Tokenize
- Split into tokens, i.e. words and operators.  Exp in Arithmetic expression
  behaves as in double quotes, but a double quote within is not treaded
  specially.
- If first token is a) an opening keyword, read next command and goto tokenize
  b) an alias, expand alias and goto tokenize c) another keyword, its a syntax
  error.

2. Each so resulting word undergoes then
-  Brace expansion

3. Each so resulting word undergoes then
- Tilde expansion.
- Parameter expansion. DQ, 1)
- Command substitution. DQ
- Arithmetic substitution. DQ

- Process substituion.
- Word splitting. NW
- Pathname expansion. NW
- Quote removal

4. Command lookup.  First word is the command name, the following words are
arguments.  If command name is +eval+, concatenate arguments into a single string
and goto tokenize.  Else setup environment and run command.

.Legend and Footnotes
DQ:: Also within double quotes
NW:: Can change the number of words.  That has effect on the following steps.
1):: +$@+ and +${NAME[@]}+ can change number of words


// # the words resulting from brace expansion are eligible for the rest of the
// # expansions.
// $ echo ~{flo,edi}
// /home/flo /home/edi
// $ xpostfix=1; ypostfix=2;
// $ echo {$x,$y}postfix
// 1 2

// # Expansions (except brace- and filename-) do not change number of words.
// # It's word splitting who does that.
// $ echo flo_text > flo; echo edi_text > edi
// $ cat $(ls edi flo)
// edi_text
// flo_text
// $ IFS=""; cat $(ls edi flo)
// cat: edi
// flo: No such file or directory


// TODO: Add to table where whites are removed (e.g. command subst, proc subst)

// Questions:
// * When is it split into lists/pipes/compound commands/commands ?


== Expansions

=== Brace expansion

..................................................
BraceExpansion = [Preamble]\{(Seq|(EltStr\,{l0}){2,})\}[Postscript];
  Seq = Num".."Num | Char".."Char;
  Num = ['[+-]]'[0-9]+;
  Char = \a;
  Str = %simple \a* %exact ('[^\\,}]*[\\'[\\,}\s]])*;
Word <=| BraceExpansion;
## The given word is replaced by the resulting space separated list
..................................................

- The string "++${++" is not eligble for the start of brace expansion
- A literal +{+ , +\+ or space must be quoted with +\+
- ++echo {a,b}$PATH++ becomes ++echo a$PATH b$PATH++ which in turn is expanded later
- ++echo $x{a,b}++ becomes ++echo $xa $xb++, whereas ++$xa++ and ++$xb++ are
  probably not defined
- ++{0,1}{0,1}...  ++is like ++{0,1}({0,1}(...))++, i.e. the left is the preamble
  of the following.

=== Tilde Expansion
..................................................
TildeExpansion = \~(TildePrefix)[\/[WordTail]];

TildePrefix =
  `+  | ## PWD
  `-  | ## OLDPWD (actually ${OLDPWD-'~-'})
  Num | ## directory stack elt, i.e. output of 'dirs Num'
  UserName;
UserName =
  ""  |  ## HOME
  %simple
  Word   ## home dir associated with that username
  %exact
  ^(Blank|'[\\/])+; ## ?? no idea if that is right

 Num = ['[+-]]'[0-9]+;

Word <=| TildeExpansion;
..................................................

If anything fails, the word is left unchanged


== Parameters / Variables
See +Parameter+, +PositionalParameter+, +SpecialParameter+, +Variable+ in
+bash.txt+.

A _parameter_ is an entity that stores values.  It is _set_ if it has been
assigned a value.

A _variable_ is a parameter denoted by an identifier.  It has a _value_ and
zero or more _attributes_ (see +declare+ builtin).

_Positional parameter_ are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is
invoked; they are temporally replaced with the arguments to a function when a
shell function is executed.  When a positional parameter consisting of more
than a single digit, it can only be referenced with +${N}+, not with +$N+.
See also the builtins +set+ and +shift+.

_Variable assignment_: Value (the lhs of assignment) undergoes tilde
expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
expansion, and quote removal.  If the variable has its `integer' attribute
set, then VALUE is evaluated as an arithmetic expression.  Word splitting is
not performed, with the exception of +"$@"+ as explained below.  Filename
expansion is not performed.  If the operator is +++=++: if identifier's
INTEGER attribute is set, add if (something with array) value is appended to
the array if its a string-valued variable, value is appended

// Todo: NAMEREF attribute

== Startup files

1) interactive login shell, or non-interactive with --login::

startup:

1. +/etc/profile+ if it exists, unless --noprofile is given
2. First existing and readable of (unless --noprofile is given). Typically the one existing sources +~/.bashrc+, see 2).
  - +~/.bash_profile+
  - +~/.bash_login+
  - +~/.profile+

upon exit: +~/.bash_logout+ if it exists

2) interactive non-login shell::
+~/.bashrc+, unless --norc is given (default when invoked as sh)

3) non-interactive::
Value of envirnoment variable +BASH_ENV+ used as file name if that file exists.

With ++--login++, also read some startup files, see above 1) above.


=== Ubuntu

- +/etc/profile+
  * sources +/etc/profile.d/*.sh+
  * sources +/etc/bash.bashrc+
- +~/.profile+
  * sources +~/.bashrc+
- +~/.bashrc+
  * sources +~/.bash_aliases+
  * sources +/etc/bash_completion+


== Interactive Shell

An interactive shell generally reads from and writes to a user's
terminal.

- either both
  * without non-option arguments, unless -s is specified
  * and without specifying -c
- or -i specified

An interactive shell has +i+ as value of ++$-++ and has the variable +PS1+ set
(i.e. it is unset in non-interactive shells).

== Login Shell

A login shell is one whose first character of argument zero is -, or one
invoked with the ++--login++ option.

+login_shell+ shell option is set.

Mechanisms outside bash: +/etc/passwd+ specifies the login shell to be used
for each user. A user can use +chsh+ to change its own login shell,
e.g. ++chsh -s myshell myusername++. Must be one of +/etc/shells+. ssh: The
commands given are executed by the remote user's login shell. If commands are
given, it is an non-interactive shell, if none are given, it becomes an
interactive shell.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Parameters
Parameter = Variable | PositionalParameter | SpecialParameter
An entity that stores a value

Positional Parameters
PositionalParameter = Digit+ except 0
Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's argument. $1 is first argument, $2 second and so on. Maybe reassigned using set builtin, but not with variable assignment. A shell function has its own local positional parameters.

Special Parameters
SpecialParameter =
Shell treats these parameters specially. They are all const.

Variables
Variable = (Letter|_)(Letter|Digit|_)* ????
Variable is a parameter denoted with a name. A Variable has a name and one or more attributes. Is either set or unset.

Types
string

integer
No support for floating point. Range ???

array
Zero based. No limit for the size of the array. Members must not be indexed or assigned continously.

notes
There are no pointers or references or the like.
Literals
IntegerLiteral =
StringLiteral = SingleQuoteLiteral | DoubleQuoteLiteral
ArrayLiteral = ([[[subscript]=]scalar] ...)
Creation / Memory management
Variables are created when they are first referenced or declared, unless when options dictate otherwise. See -o nounset.
Variables are released using unset.
There is no freestore management like malloc / free in C.
See also subchapter lifetime.
Declaration
Since variables are created when first referenced (see subchapter creation), there is no need for an explicit declaration. It is mandatory however if nounset is set to on, or to create integer variables????.
Globals
Variables are global when
- implicetely created
- declared with declare outside a function

ExplicitStringDeclaration = declare (name[=string] )+ SD
ExplicitIntegerDeclaration = declare -i (name[=integer] )+ SD

ExplicitArrayDeclaration =
1) declare -a (name[[[subscript]][=scalar]] )+ SD
2) declare -a (name[=arrayliteral] )+ SD
If subscript is not given, then the index used is the index of the previous initializier incremented by one. Indexing starts at 0. 2) Arraycopy seems ??? not to be possible, i.e name=array 3), if subscript is provided, it is ignored.
Locals
Variables are local when
- declared using local
- declared using declare inside a function

Environment variables
Are just globals marked for export. See chapter environment variables.
Scope
globals	Dynamic scoping: from creation until unset
      default
      declare	when not within a function
locals		Lexical scoping: from creation until end of block
      local		only within functions
      declare	when used within functions

Environment variables are just globals marked for export.
Lifetime
globals	from creation until end of script or until unset, whichever comes first
locals		from creation until end of block??(or function) ??unset

Environment variables are just globals marked for export.
Linkage
Since it is a scripting language, there is no linkage issue.
Operations
Referencing / Parameter expansion
name is just the string 'name', $name gets the value out of the variable with the name name. This is called parameter expansion.

ScalarValueReference =
1) $ScalarName
2) ${ScalarName[parameteroperator]}
In arithmetic expressions, $ is optional. 2nd form must be used if name must be separated from any following text. E.g "${10}" evaluates to the 10nth positional argument, whereas "$10" evaluates to the first positional argmunent followed by "0".
ArrayElementValueReference = ${ArrayName[Subscript]}	see also operations array subscript

assignment
getaddress
scalar
assignment
scalar=[scalar]

array
assignment
1) array[subscript]=[scalar]
2) array=arrayliteral
subscripting
${array[subscript]}
Curly braces are needed to avoid conflicts with shell's filename expansion operators.

Environment variables
set -a
set -k
declare -x
export

Miscellaneous
SD = \newline | ;    statement delimiter
Name = latin letters and numbers and underscore ???, case sensitive ???
Subscript = integer	Indexing starts at zero. The subscripts * and @ are special.


Reserved word:
! { } [[ ]]

control structs

if list; then list; [ elif list; then list; ] ... [ else list; ] fi
for (( ariexpr1 ; ariexpr2 ; ariexpr3 )) ; do list ; done

Quoting

escape character (\) preserves literal value of next char (except <newline>)

single quotes (') preserves literal value of all enclosed chars.

double quotes (") preserves literal value of all enclosed chars with the
following exceptions/notes: $ retains special meaning. \ retains special
meaning if followed by $ " ` \ <newline>. * becomes special meaning.
@ becomes special meaning.

Ansi-c quoting: $\'string' expands to characters as specified by the ansi-c
standart

Expansion

brace expansion: a{b,c} expands to ab ac. May be nested. At leas one comma.

tilde expansion: If a word begins with unquoted ~, all chars to the next unquoted \ build the tildeprefix. Expands to various paths. ~ allone expands to $HOME

shell parameter expansion: $word or ${...}

command substitution: $(command) or `command`. All characters between the parantheses make up the command; none are treated specially.

arithmetic expansion: $((expression)). Expression is treated as if it were within double quotes.

process substitution: <(list) or >(list)

word splitting: Each char of $IFS is treated as an delimiter.

filename expansion: each word is scanned for * ? [

quote removal:

Arrays
set array = ( $< )

Distribute datastream:
tee [FILE]: Copy stdin to stdout and also to all listened files. Option -a appends to all given files.

Process substitution: The constructs can stand everywhere where a command expects a filename as an argument
<(list)
>(list)
