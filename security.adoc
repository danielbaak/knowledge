== Public-key (aka symmetric) cryptography

public key:: Encrypt plaintext or verify digital signature.
private key:: Decrypt ciphertext or create digital signature.

It is ``impossible'' (computationally infeasible) for a private key to be
determined from its corresponding public key.


== ssh recipe
* +ssh-keygen -t rsa+
* So local machine can connect to host without having to enter password each
   time: ++ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@host++
- home and +.ssh+ directories must have exactly the permissions +700+. Files within +.ssh+ must have exactly +600+.
