Latex, AsciiDoc etc. See also character encoding.

  In English writing, quotation marks or inverted commas, also known
  informally as quotes or speech marks[1] or as quote marks, quotemarks
  or speechmarks, are punctuation marks placed either side of a word or
  phrase in order to identify it as a quotation, direct speech or a
  literal title or name. They are also used to indicate that the meaning
  of the word or phrase they surround should be taken to be different
  from (or, at least, a modification of) that typically associated with
  it; In this way, they are often used to express irony.

′ Prime symbol
″ Double prime
‴ Tripple prime
    The prime symbol ( ′ ), double prime symbol ( ″ ), and triple prime
    symbol ( ‴ ), etc., are used to designate several different units and
    for various other purposes in mathematics, the sciences, linguistics
    and music. In mathematics, the prime is generally used to generate
    more variable names for things which are similar, without resorting
    to subscripts – x′ generally means something related to or derived
    from x.

″ Ditto mark. A typographic symbol indicating that the word(s) or
  figure(s) above it are to be repeated.

   The en dash is commonly used to indicate a closed range of values—a
   range with clearly defined and finite upper and lower
   boundaries—roughly signifying what might otherwise be communicated by
   the word "through"
 — Em dash: HTML: &mdash;&#x2014;
 ‒ Figure dash. U+2012
   The figure dash is used when a dash must be used within numbers
   (e.g. phone number 555‒0199). It does not indicate a range, for which
   the en dash is used; nor does it function as the minus sign, which
   also uses a separate glyph.
