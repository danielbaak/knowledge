This is about the rules and terms of the C&plus;&plus; programming language. It is my summary of the C&plus;&plus; standard.  Best practices / guidelines are in +programming_practices.txt+ and ++cpp_guidelines.txt++.


== Expressions / Object / Value categories

An _object_ is a region of storage (simplified). Don't confuse with notion of
class object.  Functions (although it often occupies storage), references,
classes and other types, namespaces, enumerators, and templates are not
objects.  Std [intro.object] ... An object is created by a definition (3.1),
by a new-expression (5.3.4) or by the implementation (12.2) when needed.  ...

An _expression_ is a sequence of operators and their operands.  The operands
of any operator may be other expressions or primary expressions.  Each
expression has some non-reference type, and each expression belongs to exactly
one of the tree primary value categories.  _Literals_ and _identifiers_ are
primary expressions.

=== Value categories

Introduction and description of all value types:

lvalue;; Identifies a non-temporary object or a non-member function.
Properties: Those of glvalue, address may be taken, can be lhs operand of
built-in assignment operator unless non-modifiable, may be used to initialize
an lvalue reference.  Note that an lvalue can be non-modifiable.  Flori:
Examples for lvalues which don't have a name: literal string, objects on heap,
array elements

prvalue (pure rvalue);; A temporary object or a value that is not an object.
Properties: those of rvalue, cannot be polymorphic, a non-class prvalue cannot
be cv-qualified, cannot have incomplete type

xvalue;; Simplified: Things whose return type is an rvalue reference.
Properties: those of rvalue, those of glvalue.  [Flori: Saying it's about an
eXpiring object is misleading IMHO, since that also applies to rvalues in
general.]

Mixed value categories:

glvalue (generalized lvalue);; Properties: May be polymorphic, ... (few more).

rvalue;; (Flori's words:

Hence if we do have an (rvalue) reference to it, we can do with it what we want (since nobody will care),
except for bringing it into an invalid state, in order that the ctor can run
without errors)).  Properties: Address can't be taken, can't be used as lhs of
the built-in assignment operator, may be used to initialize a const lvalue
reference or a rvalue reference [that's the point which makes it movable].
Flori's note: Note that although the address can't be taken, we still can
initialize references, so internally the compiler can take the address.  Note
that it can be the lhs of an overloaded assignment operator.

The same information presented other way round: Which expressions has which value type:

|===
| Literal string                                                 | lvalue
| Function                                                       | lvalue (*to-do*: but it is not an object, how does that fit together?)
| Cast to rvalue reference to function                           | lvalue
| Variable                                                       | lvalue
| Lambda                                                         | prvalue
| Literal, not string                                            | prvalue
| Function / overloaded operator call / cast when return / cast-to type is an lvalue reference  | lvalue
| Function / overloaded operator call / cast when return / cast-to type is not a reference  | prvalue
| Function / overloaded operator call / cast when return / cast-to type is an rvalue reference to object type  | xvalue
| builtin operators: pre inc/dec, dereference, (compound) assignment, subscript (except on array xvalue), comma when if the rhs is lvalue, ternary if 2nd and 3rd are lvalues, ... (*to-do*) member stuff | lvalue
| builtin operators: post inc/dec, arithmetic, logical, comparison, address-of, comma when rhs is rvalue, ternary when either 2nd or 3rd is not lvalue, ... (*to-do* member stuff) | prvalue
| ... (*to-do*: member stuff) | xvalue
|===

=== Misc

The only really new value category C&plus;&plus;11 introduced is xvalues. The
`new' value categories glvalue and prvalue are only to name different `new'
regions of the Venn diagram which emerged due to the introduction of xvalues.
xvalues in turn were added as a consequence of the addition of rvalue
references.

++return _expression_;++: Returning by value may involve construction and
copy/move of a temporary object, unless copy elision is used.  Flori's
abbreviation: if the expression is an lvalue it is tagged to be an rvalue
(*to-do*: xvalue or prvalue ?) so the move constructor or copy constructor
taking reference to const may be taken.
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/return

+std::move+ doesn't move and +std::forward+ doesn't forward. +move+ is an
__un__conditional cast to rvalue, and +forward+ is an _conditional_ cast to
rvalue. When +move(x)+ is passed as an argument to a function/operator, it's
nearly certain that +x+ gets modified (else the move semantics woudn't make
sense, and if there is no move semantic overload, wrapping in +move+ makes no
sense). When implementing +foo(T&&)+, technically the same thing as in
+foo(T&)+ can be implemented. The ++T&&++ case however, in contrast to ++T&++
case, is allowed to take advantage of the fact that the caller does not need
the information stored in the object anymore; the caller only needs the object
to be in a valid state; he still needs to call at least the destructor. The
++T&&++ implementation usually steals the guts while ensuring the object is
still in a valid state.



*to-do*: Questions:

- What does prvalue description fragment ``a value that is not an object''
  mean?
- What is the purpose of the new value category xvalue (and the resulting
  glvalue and prvalue). They are not needed for move semantics, because
  distinction rvalue to lvalue already defines whether it's movable or not.

== References

C&plus;&plus;11 adds rvalue references.  Now we can also modify rvalues
through them.  *To-do*: Are my words correct?: rvalue reference has the
semantic of: I can modify they content in any way; however nobody will see the
change since nobody will reference thee again (except for destructor and methods which only write but do not read before writing).  So the modification typically is stealing what ever thou owns.
The only constraint is that I must leave you in a valid state so your
destructor and assignment operator (*to-do*: why assignment?)  can run.  An
lvalue reference can naturally do the same modifications, but it cannot bind
to rvalues; The use case of stealing from rvalues is much more common (since
they are never used again after the stealing) than stealing from lvalues
(since they might be used again after that stealing).

Which expressions can bind to which references. P__n__ is, in the field of
overload resolution, about which is a better match; a smaller number is a better
match than a higher number.

|===
|                                       | mut lvalue | immut lvalue | mut rvalue | immut rvalue
| ++T&&++: rvalue reference             |            |              | y (*) P1   |
| ++const T&&++: const rvalue reference |            |              | y (#) P2   | y (#) P1
| ++T&++: lvalue reference              | y P1       |              |            |
| ++const T&++: const lvalue reference  | y P2       | y            | y P3       | y P2
|===

(*) The one important change in C&plus;&plus;11.  Having rvalue references we
can also bind to mutable rvalue and modify it through the reference.  Using
++const T&++ we could already bind to rvalues before, but we could not modify
them through the reference.

(#) Const rvalue references are also new, but in general not really useful,
with const lvalue references we can already bind to rvalues.

When there are multiple y in a column, overload resolution must choose between
the multiple viable overloaded methods. Concerning the cases of th above table, the rules for which viable match is better : 1) rvalue reference is better than an lvalue reference 2) less cv-qualified is better.


== Initialization


static	thread local	local	member, initialized in initializer list	member, initialized in class body	heap/new	temporary	return value	parameter	exception obj when throwing	exception obj when catching
initializers for locals:

blank
()
(x), interpretable as types yes/no. Direct initialization, possibly narrowing conversions when initializing builtin types.
(2plusargs), interpretable as types yes/no
{}
{x}. initializer_list ctor is prefered over ctor taking x's type (possibly with conversions). No narrowing conversion when initializing builtin types. Called direct initialization.
{2plusargs}
\= arg
\= {}
\= {x}
\= {2plusargs}

unsorted:

- the standard is explicit that an empty ++{ }++ list means to call the default constructor if available

Guidelines:

- If you provide an initializer-list constructor, also provide a default
  constructor with the same semantics as though you were initializinng with a
  zero-size initializer_list.



Most vexing parse::
The standard says ``If it can be a function declaration, it is.''. Thus both of
the following are function declarations, not object definitions: ++T obj();++
and ++T obj(foo(),bar())++, given foo and bar are types. Another reason not to
use initializers based on parens.

== auto


Strips top-level cv-qualifier (but there's a universal references exception with const) and all kind of references.

``Avoid creating unnecessary objects'' -- quote from whom?. ++[const] auto++
creates a new object, ++const auto&++ / ++auto&&++ only gives a name / an alias to an
already existing object.

++auto foo = initializer++ is bad because
- case initializer is an lvalue (i.e. move ctor is not applycable): the type might not be copyable. In other words: for this to work, a copy ctor is required
- in the case initializer is a call returning a refernce to some internal object, e.g. +at()+ of containers: foo is a copy, and modifying foo does not modify the original object, which might not be what was intended


const auto& / auto&&: give an already existing object (another) name: the returned object (a temporary or an lvalue) a name (avoids creating an unneccessairy copy)
const auto / auto: creates a new object: create a copy / initialize a new object with a literal

??? how to store result of addrof operator?

Herbs suggestion for input parameters (i.e. const local) where we don't know
properties of type's ctors is 'const T&'. In contrast to function parameters, a
local ref does not need to be implemented as pointer, so there is no indirection
overhead relative to auto. Herb's suggestion for in/out (i.e. writable)
parameters where properties of type is not know is T&. However that has the
disadvantage that rvalues can't be passed, which is ok, since the caller does
not see the modified rvalue, since rvalues or nearly always temporaries. Isn't
for templates which modify the parameter the recomendation to use 'template<class
T> foo(auto&&)'?

also use const auto & / auto&& for result of operators. After all we don't know
the type, i.e. member functions could be called.

range-based for loop: the collection object, and its elements, most probably
don't get destroyed, i.e. the const auto& / auto&& variable most probably
continues to refer to an valid object. Also when calling a method. Due to
structured lifetimes, its very probable that the const T& param continues to
refer to an valid obj. Not so with local references: when bound to an object
that was returned via an reference to it, it is not that easy to detect that the
local reference still exists, but the refered to object has been deleted.
