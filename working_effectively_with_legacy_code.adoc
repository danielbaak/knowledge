= Working Effectively with Legacy Code

My personal summary of the book with the same name.



Global objects or functions (inclusive non-private static class) have an
unbound amount of clients.  If those globals are an problem in a test harness,
than any object depending directly or indirectly on them can't be (easily)
tested.  It's not unlikely that thus many objects can't be (easily) be
tested. 


== Flori's summary
- legacy code = code without (unit) tests
- Basic dilelema with legacy code: We need to introduce tests. For that, we often need to do refactorings. But refactorings should only be done with tests in place.
- The initial refacrtorings to get tests in place must be low risk. For that purpose we're also willing to create little design sins.
- The goal is to get code under test. For that purpose, also little design sins are allowed. As soon as the test is there, we can use refactorings to clean up any design kludges.
- At least test newly added methods

Seam = A place where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place. Seam types
  * preprocessor seams: redefine foo
  * link seams: link another definition of foo
  * object seams (aka test double): replace real object by a test double object

- Make use of refactoring tools to minimize risk

- Sprout method/class: the new functionality is implemented completely separated in a new method or new class



== Dependency-Braking Techniques

=== Adapt parameter

The advice is pretty close to DIP, and has actually a wider applicability than
just parameters: High level code shall access low level code via interfaces
which are under control of the high level code (INeed instead IProvide).  In
case the low level code is a 3rd party library, the hope is also that the
interface needed and thus created by the high level code is smaller, thus
easier, than the one provided by the 3rd party code.


=== Break out method object

Motivation: Test a method, say +execute+, of a class, say +Provider+, that
can't be instantiated in the test.

Solution: Create a new class, say +Executor+ with the responsibility of
hosting the method.  Move the +execute+ method from +Provider+ to
+Executor+. If the method references members of +Provider+, extract an new
Interface +IProviderForExecutor+ from +Provider+, and let +Executor+'s
constructor take a reference to it and save it in a member of +Executor+. Now
a test can create an +Executor+ as unit under test, and can create a test
double implementing +IProviderForExecutor+.


=== Definition completion

`Only' repetition of link seam idea, i.e. when linking the test executable,
another definition (aka implementation) of a given (class) declaration is used
then when linking the productive executable.


=== Encapsulate Global References

From what I get so far the transformation is only: group a set of globals (aka
non-members, data or methods) into a new class and instantiate one globals
object of that class.  I.e. the only difference is that the formerly
`distributed' global objects are now grouped in an
parent-global-object.  *to-do*: do I miss anything?


=== Expose static method

This is the simple version of ``Primitivize Parameter''.

Motivation: Test a method of a class that can't be instantiated in the test.

Solution: Make it a class static method, which of course presumes that the
method does not access any instance members.  That way no instance of the
class is required and the method can be tested.

Downsides: Note however that now it's also more difficult to create a test
double for this method.


=== Extract and override call

Motivation: To be able to test class A we want a test double for a method that
A calls, or more generally, for a whole code fragment A implements.

Solution: Create a new virtual method in A which just calls the method to be
test doubled (or in the more general case, contains that code fragment).  In a
testing subclass of A, A's new method is overriden with a test double.

C&plus;&plus; Note: This does not work for code fragments in the constructor,
since when constructor calls a virtual method, the virtual mechanism does not
kick in.  See ``Extract and override getter''


=== Extract and override factory method

I don't see a difference to ``Extract and override call''.  It's only that in
this chapter the topic is a code fragment in the constructor which as a whole
creates a new object, which is then assigned to a member (smart) pointer.


=== Extract and override getter

Motivation: Using C&plus;&plus; ``Extract and override call'' is not
applicable within a constructor as noted in that chapter.  ``Extract and
override getter'' is applicable for the use case where the code fragment to be
test doubled initializes a member in the constructor.

Solution: Replace each reference to the member with a new virtual getter
method.  The getter method lazy initializes the member on its first call.


=== Extract implementer

I don't see a difference to ``Extract Interface''??????


=== Extract Interface

The title says it all.


=== Introduce Instance Delegator

Motivation: To be able to test double a class static method.

Solution: Add an instance method which just calls the class static method.
The UUT has now to instantiate the DOC class with some technique (*to-do*:
examples)


=== Introduce static setter

Motivation: You want to replace the object the static +S& instance()+ method
of a singleton +S+ returns by a test double.

Solution:

- Make the singleton's constructor protected (normally it's private)
- Add a protected static method +setInstance(S&)+
- Add a test double class +STestDouble+ which publicly inherits from +S+
- Add a public static method to +STestDouble+ which is called by the test and
  internally sets the static instance of its base object via the new
  +setInstance+ method
- +STestDouble+ can override all methods it needs to and thus is a test double
  of +S+.


=== Link Substitution

Again (as Definition Completion), again just repetition of the link seam idea.


=== Parameterize Constructor

Motivation: A class X can't serve as UUT or can't be test doubled because its
constructor sets a member internally in a fixed way; we need a way to change
the value of that member, typically letting it point to another object.

Solution: Add a parameter to the constructor, and the member is set to the
that parameter.  To preserve the constructor's signature, either overload it
where as the original constructor calls the new more general constructor or
add the new parameter with a default argument.

Downside: The interface depends now on one more type.


=== Parameterize Method

Same as the previous one, only that in this scenario it is about an member
instance method that sets an member internally.


=== Primitivize Parameter

Motivation: You want to test method +foo+ of class +X+, but you can't
instantiate X in the test harness.

Solution: Extract the body of +foo+ to a new static method +sfoo+. Naturally
that means that all accessed instance members need now to be passed as
parameters.  Choose the primitive enough types on sfoo's signature, i.e. types
that can be instantiated in the test harness.  The +foo+ instance method now
just delegates to the new +sfoo+, passing its instance members as arguments,
possibly massaging them into the primitive types expected by sfoo's
signature.  The test harness now tests +sfoo+.


=== Pull Up Feature

Motivation: You can't instantiate a class in a test.  The entity (method,
member, ...), say +foo+, you are interested in is independent of the reason(s)
why the class can't be instantiated in the test.

Solution: Pull up +foo+ and everything referenced by it (by problem statement
all things that don't prevent instantiation), into an new (abstract) base
class.  The test harness can then instantiate that base class, or a sub class
of it created for testing purposes.


=== Push Down Dependency

Motivation: Same as ``Pull Up Feature''

Solution: Similar idea as ``Pull Up Feature''.  Again there is a base class
which can be instantiated (at least when sub classed) and a derived class
which corresponds to the original class.  Only that now the original class is
the base class and makes the methods containing the `bad' dependencies pure
virtual, and the derived class is the new class implements those pure virtual
methods with the original bodies.

Downsides: Much more needs to be protected so the derived production class can
still access the same members.


=== Replace Function with Function Pointer

Motivation: You want to test double a free function, say +foo+. Intended for a
non-OO language where OO approaches are not applicable.

Solution: Add a global function pointer named +foo+, rename the free function
to another name, initialize the pointer in some start up routine.  The test
harness can let the function pointer point to a test double implementation.


=== Replace Global Reference with Getter

Motivation: You want to test +X::foo+, but it accesses a global entity +bar+
which you want to replace with a test double.

Solution: Add a virtual method +getbar+ to +X+ and let +foo+ access +bar+ via
+getbar+.  Inherit a +TestingX+ from +X+, which can override +getbar+ to
return a test double replacing the original +bar+.


=== Subclass and Override Method

*To-do*: I don't see a difference to ``Extract and override call''.


=== Supersede Instance Variable

Motivation: We want to be able to change the instance variable which is set by
the constructor in a language that doesn't allow virtual method calls from
within a constructor.

*To-do*: I don't get it.  I assume it's as simple as just giving access to a
member data via a setter method which is used by the test harness.


==== Flori

Motivation: Test double a free function or class static method

Solution: Internally the method delegates the work via a new indirection.
E.g. a function pointer, or to a method of an object which is retrieved via an
singleton.

//  LocalWords:  INeed IProvide LocalWords IProviderForExecutor getter UUT
//  LocalWords:  setInstance STestDouble gfoo sfoo
